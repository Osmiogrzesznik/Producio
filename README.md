Before we start, if you are continuing production and some parts  have been done so far, or you have measured BTB cycle already you may provide these information to get more accurate estimates right away. However it is entirely optional, and program will run statistics normally even without these data, you may acquire better results and have more options, providing some of it.

DEV W.I.P NOTES:
<BR>

-incorporate PHP and databases to make saving states and presets possible for user. Now you can use only CLIPBOARD to copy the JSON format savestate string.

<br>
BUGs to do:


<br>
-SAVE DON'T WORK FOR CHART.JS MODULE(DOESN'T EVEN CREATE CANVAS FOR IT )


<br>
-taking break at start breaks averager? 



<br>
TO DO:


<br>

- cycles doesn't have to equal parts. i.e. 1cycle  may produce one pair. preset must include it
<br>
- availability to plan multiple different jobs one after another, plus break, setting time
